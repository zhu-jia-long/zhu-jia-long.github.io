## About Myself
My name is Jialong Zhu (朱嘉隆), and I am a passionate AI researcher and engineer specializing in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. With a First-Class postgraduate degree in Computer Science from the University of Warwick and a bachelor degree from Queen’s University Belfast, I built a strong foundation in machine learning, AI as well as data structures and algorithms.

By working with Huawei, I supervised on cutting-edge AI agent technologies, including RAG, prompt engineering, question rewriting, and LLM orchestration. My expertise extends to LLM infrastructure—fine-tuning, NER model training, and transformer-based architectures. I thrive on solving complex AI challenges and am committed to advancing intelligent systems that are both powerful and practical.
